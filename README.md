# Stone Age for iOS

## Setting up

1. [Install PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com)
2. Check out the code
3. Open the project in Xcode
4. Run the project to see it in the iOS simulator

Alternatively, if you don't need to test any iOS specific functionality, just open ```www/index.html``` in a browser.

## Conventions

* Try *really hard* to keep this working in both the browser and the iOS simulator.
